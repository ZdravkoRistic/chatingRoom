Team Portfolio and Chat Application

This application represents a team portfolio showcasing the projects we have worked on as a team. Additionally, the application includes a chat functionality for communication with visitors.

Features
Project Showcase: The application allows the display of projects that our team has worked on. Projects can be presented through HTML code or dynamically loaded from a database.
Chat Functionality: Visitors can use the chat functionality to send us messages or ask questions about our projects or services. Messages are displayed in real-time, and we can respond to them.
